# Problem Statement
A shopping mall is facing declining sales and revenue over the past few years even though the footfall hasn't reduced. It has been identified that this is mainly due to the  emergence of online shopping and the better shopping experiences it offers.

# Solution
Our solution covers four main aspects-
1. Mall layout optimization through spatial data analytics: Customers complained about walking a lot to get to the desired shops and not getting what they were looking for. Thus, we analyzed the footfall patterns across floors and suggested some layout overhauls to make it easier for shoppers to find what they are looking for while ensuring that they explore the entirety of the mall during their search.
2. Analysis of category-specific visiting patterns for different time scales to identify time periods in which the popularity of different categories of shops is at its highest. We then recommend various solutions to leverage these findings.
3. Digital transformation for a personalized experience: Developed a POC for a personalized marketing solution using the data provided. Used Partitioning-around Medoids clustering for for segmenting customers based on their demographic information as well as time spent during each section.
